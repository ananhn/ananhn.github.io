          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>At Flora Petals, we believe flowers speak the language of the heart. Whether it's joy, comfort, gratitude, or love â€” every arrangement we create is a message in bloom.</p>
          <p>Flora Petals was founded in 2022 by Lorelei, a passionate florist with a vision to create beautiful, seasonally-inspired floral designs that celebrate the natural beauty of flowers.</p>
          <p>After years of working in traditional flower shops, Loralei wanted to create a space where creativity could flourish and where every arrangement would tell a unique story. She believed that flowers should be arranged in a way that honors their natural forms and seasonal qualities.</p>
          <p>Born from a love of nature and artistry, Flora Petals is a boutique flower studio passionate about crafting meaningful arrangements. From everyday bouquets to wedding florals, we bring beauty to every stem.</p>
          <p>Our team of floral designers takes pride in every petal, stem, and ribbon. We work closely with local growers and sustainable sources, ensuring every bouquet is as responsible as it is beautiful.</p>
          <p>Today, Flora Petals has grown into a beloved local flower boutique known for our artistic approach to floral design and our commitment to sustainability. Each bouquet we create is thoughtfully designed to bring joy and beauty into your life or the lives of those you care about.</p>
